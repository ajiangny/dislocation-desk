"""Ingest: pull price and volume history from Polymarket and Kalshi into the local cache.

Every venue client returns the same shape so the detector never cares where data came from:
    DataFrame indexed by UTC timestamp, columns `price` (0..1) and `volume` (may be NaN).

NOTE: the endpoints below were checked against the official docs only; live
calls were blocked in the sandbox this scaffold was written in. Run
`python scripts/smoke_test_apis.py` first and fix field names if a response
doesn't match.
